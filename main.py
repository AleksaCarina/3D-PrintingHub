"""
FastAPI application for the 3Dâ€‘PrintingHub project.

This module defines a small FastAPI app that serves a simple landing
page at the root path (`/`). The page is rendered from a Jinja2 template
and includes a short welcome message along with an illustrative image.

To run this app locally, first install the dependencies listed in
`requirements.txt` and then start the server with:

    uvicorn main:app --reload

This will launch a development server on `localhost` port 8000. When
deployed in a production environment, use a proper ASGI server such as
Uvicorn or Hypercorn behind a reverse proxy.
